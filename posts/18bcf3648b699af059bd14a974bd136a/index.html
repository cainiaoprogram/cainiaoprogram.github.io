 <p>I'm trying to make a program with a GUI (most likely using Kivy) in Python to match the exposure of two images. I want to display both images (RGB or grayscale) side by side with their corresponding histograms and have a slider to be able to control the exposure on the selected image. I would like some advise on how to go about this.</p> 
 <p>So far I have read several posts and there seem to be several ways to approach calculating the histogram of an image (numpy, matplotlib, openCV, and PIL), however I'm confused about which would be best (least libraries/dependencies to install) for me to implement. I have also read about changing the exposure on an image and some people mention changing brightness and contrast, so you need to change both to change exposure? I know openCV has equalizeHist but that does it automatically and what I would like is for both images to have as close as possible overall exposure; that's why I was thinking of doing it manually. It would be great if could do it automatically, but I'm still thinking on how to do it.</p> 
 <p>I know you guys place tremendous value on your time so I'll understand if you don't have time to answer this in depth.</p> 
 <p>解决方案</p> 
 <p>It sounds as though you are interested in histogram matching, though. I have some code for that purpose here, but it is not well tested:</p> 
 <p>If you do find that code useful, feel free to make a pull request to scikit-image and we can try to integrate it into the package.</p>
