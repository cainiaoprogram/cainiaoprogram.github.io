                    <div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The concept: </strong></span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">The long term aim of the project is to develop a fully functional software, known as DataViz, for plotting and processing datasets, which will be eventually deployed and released for all students in the department to use in their reports, data processing, and as a show case of an authentic  experience of software development for the students of ELEC362. The development is planned over 5 years, which started in 2022. Each year the cohort of ELEC362 will be asked to make a major  upgrade to the software (will be referred to as the control version in this report). </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">Each header file of every class in the control version (source files) of the project contains a comment explaining what the purpose of the class is. The features currently available in the app can be found under “Help” menu. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Upgrades required for this year: </strong></span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">For this year you are asked to implement the following upgrades to DataViz 0.0 (the control version) to end up with DataViz 0.2: </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- Introduce a way in the app allowing the user to change the width of the curve, its colour, and its style<strong>*</strong></span> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- Update the design of the help window so that it becomes organised into sections which are easy to add to and expand in the future. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- Introduce a way in the app where the names of loaded Datasets can be made available to the user, so that they can add a comment to describe what each dataset represents. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- Define another mean in the app to enable the user to draw a dataset. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- Introduce a way in the app where it allows multiple datasets to be plotted into a single graph window <strong>*</strong></span> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- Create an entry “Function” under the menu “Analysis”, which should allow the user to input a mathematical expression containing the names of datasets. For example, “D1*exp(-D2)”. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">For this purpose, use the classes defined in the header atmsp.h (An example test project showing how to use this header file has been uploaded to CANVAS)<strong>*</strong></span> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- Adding a feature for a histogram plot (you can generate the </span> 
 <span style="color:#0000ff;">histogram </span> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">in GSL and plot it in QCustomPlot via </span> 
 <span style="color:#0000ff;">QCPBars </span> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">class). </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">You may assume that all the datasets in the app will have the same x-coordinates. To refer to what asterisks mean please refer to the last question in FAQ section. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">After you are done with the upgrade; make sure that: </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- All the features you add are working well. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- You updated the help window in the app to include instructions on how to use the app after the features you added. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">- </span> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">You handled a range of potential errors that may be experienced in the updated app. </span> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <span style="color:#000000;">It is an expectation from everyone to consult Qt documentation to find any functions or classes that might be useful for the implementation of the project. Finally, you should make the programme as </span>professional as possible. Imagine this project as a real-life project given to you, and that in the next years, it will be developed further by other students. 
 <div> 
  <span style="color:#000000;">Note for Mac OS users: You can develop the application based on Mac version of the app. The application will be tested and marked on a Windows machine. You should verify that your app works as it should on one of the computers in the lab before submission, to avoid any potential cross</span> 
 </div> 
 <div> 
  <span style="color:#000000;">platform issue, if you have any problems, please let me know. </span> 
 </div> 
 <div> 
  <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Suggested approach to be followed: </strong></span> 
 </div> 
 <div> 
  <span style="color:#000000;">Start by implementing the simplest tasks. For more advanced tasks, a good idea is to learn how to implement these features in an empty app. Once that works, you can adapt the code from the empty project into the control version. Note that is merely a suggestion and it has no impact on your mark whether you followed it or not. </span> 
 </div> 
 <div> 
  <span style="color:#000000;">If you are unsure contact the module coordinator for any assistance. </span> 
 </div> 
 <div> 
  <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The deliverables </strong></span> 
 </div> 
 <div> 
  <span style="color:#000000;">Every submission should consist of the project’s files in a zip file + the code copied-pasted in a PDF file. The name of the zip file as well as the report must be your name (MohammadHasan.zip and MohammadHasan.pdf). The PDF file must not be zipped. </span> 
 </div> 
 <div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Questions and Answers: </strong></span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">Should I learn the entire code in the control version? </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">No, you should be able using the material taught in this module to find the relevant part of the code where you need to edit, get familiar with that part to update it. You are not expected to know how everything works from the previous year. </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">The control version has a lot of codes from elsewhere such as GSL, QCustomPlot, and ATMSP. Should I learn all of that? </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">No, you need to only know the bit that you need. </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">What if I have a better idea than the control version? Or if I want to modify it? </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">Any improvement is welcome, ranging from creatin an icon for the project to designing a better startup screen, to making more general modifications to the code. However, if you do something that is not part of the required upgrades, the benefit to you is that you will get an acknowledgment in the about section. Your mark will be based only on the required upgrades listed above. If you are interested in doing this, please consult the module </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">coordinator before you start working on it. </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">How will the markers know how my design works if there is no report? </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">By referring to the updated help window in the app. You should make sure that it is updated in such a way that reflects how the upgraded app should be used. </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">what if I only did some of the features requested? Will my mark in the three marking criteria be affected? </span> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A: </strong></span> 
   <span style="color:#000000;">Meeting all the requirements will primarily affect MC1. Some the requirements require more work than others, which were labelled with an asterisk *. Not doing these may impact other MC as well. If you want to prioritise task, make sure you do the ones with asterisk first. </span>
